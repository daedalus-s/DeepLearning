# DeepLearning W.I.P.
A collection of two projects from the Rutgers Deep Learning Course, Spring 2022. 
### Assignment 2

**autograd_and_nn:** Implements a convolutional image classifer using pyTorch on various levels of abstraction. Able to classify over 50,000 RGB 32x32 images with ~70% accuracy. 

**linear_classifer:** Implements a linear based classifer network with softmax implementation.

### Assignment 3

**neural_machine_translation.ipynb** Takes sequence data of the English and French languages and creates a translator from English to French. Built on a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. Achieved an accuracy of 90.25%.
